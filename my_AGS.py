    First we perform NN on all features, push them into our

    After going through all possible features we select
    the best feature to be added to our set.
    Now we begin to add to our set of features one at a time
    from our queue.
    However, it the next feature in our heap decreases our accuracy, we will try to
    salvage it by going through the next X features in our heap defined by 'depth.'
    The depth should depend on the number of features.
    If we do not find a suitable feature with our depth we remake our heap.
    Since the search will take longer the more we remake our heap, we will only
    allow it to be remade once.
    If it does improve our accuracy, we add it and continue.
    There will also be a maximum limit to the number of features we can have.
    The maximum number of features will be 5.
